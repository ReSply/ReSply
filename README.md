# ReSply

To resupply your Shopping List.
Scan food packaging as you throw it away to add it to your shopping list.

This iOS app was written at [HackZurich 2014](http://www.hackzurich.com/). It uses the AVCaptureSession Framework of iOS to read barcodes and fetches product info from a temporary Migros API.
The project is written in Swift and uses [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) for JSON parsing and [FMDB](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb) as an SQLite wrapper.
Thanks to Apple's Camera Team for the support!
